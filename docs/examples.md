## üöÄ How to Use These Examples

1. **Copy any prompt** from the examples above
2. **Paste it into your MCP client** (like Cursor)
3. **Watch the magic happen** as the system:
   - Analyzes your request
   - Chooses the optimal diagram format
   - Generates the diagram code
   - Renders it to a professional image

## üí° Tips for Creating Your Own Prompts

- **Be specific** about what you want to visualize
- **Mention relationships** between components
- **Include context** about the domain (business process, software architecture, etc.)
- **Specify output preferences** if you have them
- **Let the system choose** the format for best results

## üîÑ Workflow Pattern

All examples follow this pattern:
```
Choose the best diagram format for [YOUR_REQUIREMENT], then generate the diagram code and render it to an image file. Save the result as [OUTPUT_NAME]
```

This single prompt triggers the complete workflow:
1. **Format Selection** (`help_choose_diagram`)
2. **Code Generation** (`get_diagram_instructions`)
3. **Professional Rendering** (`render_diagram`)
